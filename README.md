# Basic-Calculator-Android-App
The app allows operands in negative, positive, double numbers
There are 6 operations such as sum, subtraction, multiple, division, square root, percent.
An error pops up when there are missing 2 operands, or 1 of 2 operands while doing operations.
Technically, the error pops up if divided by 0, square root or percent of a negative number
It depends on an android device, an interface may be different.
I designed this app interface on Nexus 5 device
